Dependencies and Compatibility
--

Tested with node 0.8.1
Sails is built on the rock-solid foundations of ExpressJS and Socket.io.  


## Who Built This?
The Sails framework was developed by @mikermcneil and is supported by Balderdash Co (@balderdashy).  We build realtime web and mobile apps as a service for our customers, and over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, I ended up crystallizing all our best code and conventions into Sails.  
Then, we open-sourced it, because no one should have to go through that again.  Seriously.  Hopefully, it makes your life a little bit easier!
